Functional end-to-end testing of https://dog.ceo/

After taking a quick look at the website, I would expect a functional test plan to focus on the 
main functionalities of the web page. After a brief scan of the web page, I noticed that the main
elements to take note of are the various links on the home page. Therefore my proposed test plan 
will involve the testing of these links to ensure they are working as expected.

Test Case 1: Expect the API link to take the user to the API url @ "https://dog.ceo/dog-api/"
	- Ensure that all content is displayed

Test Case 2: Expect the Math problem link to take the user to the correct url @ "https://dog.ceo/maths-problems-birch-swinnerton-dyer"
	- Ensure that all content is displayed
	- Within this test case we will also need to ensure that the links on this page are all working.
	This includes: the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer link, the rolling over in business link, as well as
	the Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord link to all take the user to their respective urls @
	"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birch_and_Swinnerton-Dyer_conjecture"
	"https://dog.ceo/when-to-roll-over"
	"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_von_Hammerstein-Equord"

	*side note for this page, after clicking on the "rolling over" link from this page and then clicking on the back button
	on the "rolling over" page, the user is returned to the main home page. While this is not a bug persay, in terms of user
	expectation one would expect to be returned to the Math problem page. This can be implemented via breadcrumbs.*

Test Case 3: Expect the When to roll over link to take the user to the correct url @ "https://dog.ceo/when-to-roll-over"
	- Ensure that all content is displayed, and that the top ten tips link is working and redirects to
	"https://dog.ceo/top-ten-tips-for-business"

Test Case 4: Expect the top ten tips link to take the user to the url @ "https://dog.ceo/top-ten-tips-for-business"

Test Case 5: Expect the exterior links like the mail, linkedin, and twitter to redirect to appropriate url
	- "https://www.linkedin.com/in/dog-ceo/"
	- "https://twitter.com/dog__CEO"



Functional testing of https://dog.ceo/dog-api/demo.php

Test Case 1: Expect the page to display an image of the correct breed after requesting
	- Whatever option the user chooses from the drop down menu to select the breed, the expected behavior is 
	that the page will show a random image of a dog of that breed. This can be verified in a few ways: the manual
	way involves verifying by sight that the displayed dog is indeed of the breed that was chosen. Another way is
	to see what the link of the image is, and assuming that all images are named correctly the link should say the
	breed in the url

Test Case 2: Expect the page to display a random image of the same breed after clicking "More of this breed" button
	- Page should be displaying the same breed as originally selected
